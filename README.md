# Battleship

**Battleship** (also _Battleships_ or _Sea Battle_) is a strategy type guessing 
game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which 
each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The 
locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players 
alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the 
objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

This game was initially coined by _Milton Bradley_ an American business magnate, 
game pioneer and publisher.

In this project, we will reproduce this classic game. There are distinct 
variations of the Battleship game, but we will use the original rules 
written by Milton Bradley. To start the game, you have five ships to 
organize on 10Ã—10 game field.

The meaning of different symbols used in the battlefield:
- ~: fog; 
- O: cell of a ship
- X: hit
- M: miss
